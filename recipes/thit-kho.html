				<h2 class="subheading">Description</h2>
				<p>
					This Vietnamese thịt kho recipe is a low and slow braise with suuuper
					tender and flavorful pork, with hard-boiled eggs that have absorbed
					all the seasoning too. It’s traditionally served around the lunar new
					year because of how well it keeps after cooking.
				</p>
				<p>
					It’s savory, salty, and slightly sweet seasoned mainly with fish sauce
					and soy sauce paired with hard-boiled eggs. Served atop a large mound
					of steamed white rice, and a side of pickled mustard greens, these are
					the flavors and memories of my childhood.

				<h2 class="subheading">Steps</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Cut the pork into 1.5" cubes. I like this size for ease of eating,
						and it cooks faster than 1 huge chunk of pork.
					</li>
					<li>
						Bring 2-3 quarts of tap water boiling on high, or enough to fully
						submerge the pork. When the water's boiling, add the pork for 1-2
						minutes just to clean it. Drain then rinse the pork under running
						water until the water is clear.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add the coconut soda, fish sauce and salt to the pot, then add
						filtered water so it just about covers the pork.
					</li>
					<li>
						Turn the heat to high. When boiling, lower heat to about 25% heat or
						until you still see a low boil. Simmer for about 1.5 to 2 hours
						total, leaving covered for the first 40 minutes. Check and stir the
						pot every 20 minutes. The longer you cook it, the softer the pork
						gets. After 40 minutes, remove the cover to let the liquid reduce so
						you get a more concentrated sauce later.
					</li>
					<li>
						Make the caramel color (nuoc mau) in a separate pot and add it to
						the pot of thit kho
					</li>
					<li>
						Make the hard-boiled eggs: add the eggs to a pot and cover the eggs
						with cold water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil on medium-high heat.
						Remove from heat and let it sit for 8 minutes. Cool under running
						water and peel the shells.
					</li>
					<li>
						During the last ~30-40 minutes of cooking add the peeled eggs and
						onions.
					</li>
					<li>
						The final goal is to reduce the liquid about 1/3 of the starting
						amount, but you can do it based your own taste of the sauce and pork
						softness. When the pork hits a doneness you like, re-season with
						salt or fish sauce, or add water to thin out to your taste. Remember
						you want it a bit saltier since it will dilute when eating with
						rice.
					</li>
				</ol>
