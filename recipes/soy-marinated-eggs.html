			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>
				What’s better than a jammy egg? One that’s been sitting in a tangy-salty
				marinade of chiles, soy, mirin, and vinegar, like this classic star of
				Korean banchan. The longer you let them sit, the more flavor they’ll
				pick up, but if you only have an hour, serve egg quarters with some of
				the pickling liquid drizzled over for extra flavor.

			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Gently lower eggs into a large saucepan of boiling water. When water
					returns to a gentle boil, cook 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon,
					transfer to a bowl of ice water and let cool 2 minutes (eggs may still
					be a little warm). Remove eggs from ice water and peel.
				</li>

					Meanwhile, bring garlic, chiles, soy sauce, mirin, vinegar, and 2 cups
					water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce heat; simmer 5 minutes.
					Remove from heat and add eggs. Let sit at least 1 hour.
				</li>
				<li>
					To serve, drain eggs, quarter, and sprinkle with sesame seeds if
					desired.
